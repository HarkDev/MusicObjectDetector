# Music Object Detector

This repository is the home of a Faster R-CNN implementation for Music Symbols to implement a fast and reliable Music Symbol detector with Deep Learning.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apacha/MusicObjectDetector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apacha/MusicObjectDetector)

Note my previous projects that [classified entire sheets](https://github.com/apacha/MusicScoreClassifier) or [learnt to classify different music symbols](https://github.com/apacha/MusicSymbolClassifier).


# Running the application
This repository contains several scripts that can be used independently of each other. 
Before running them, make sure that you have the necessary requirements installed. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Keras 2.0.6
- Tensorflow 1.2.1 (or optionally tensorflow-gpu 1.2.1)

Optional: If you want to print the graph of the model being trained, install GraphViz on Windows via http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php and add /bin to the PATH or run `sudo apt-get install graphviz` on Ubuntu (see https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/3210)

For installing Tensorflow and Keras we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or 
[Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as Python distribution (we did so for preparing Travis-CI and it worked).

To accelerate training even further, you can make use of your GPU, by installing tensorflow-gpu instead of tensorflow
via pip (note that you can only have one of them) and the required Nvidia drivers. For Windows, we recommend the
[excellent tutorial by Phil Ferriere](https://github.com/philferriere/dlwin). For Linux, we recommend using the
 official tutorials by [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation).

## Training the model

TBD
