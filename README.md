# Music Object Detector

This repository is the home of a Faster R-CNN implementation for Music Symbols to implement a fast and reliable Music Symbol detector with Deep Learning.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apacha/MusicObjectDetector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apacha/MusicObjectDetector)

Note my previous projects that [classified entire sheets](https://github.com/apacha/MusicScoreClassifier) or [learnt to classify different music symbols](https://github.com/apacha/MusicSymbolClassifier).

An extensive overview of the results of different parameters is documented in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MT4CH9yJD_vM9nT8JgnfmzwAVIuRoQYEyv-5FHMjYVo/edit?usp=sharing).

# Running the application
This repository contains several scripts that can be used independently of each other. 
Before running them, make sure that you have the necessary requirements installed. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Keras 2.0.9
- Tensorflow 1.4.0 (or optionally tensorflow-gpu 1.4.0)
- [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools 2015](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) (for faster data_generator)

Optional: If you want to print the graph of the model being trained, install GraphViz on Windows via http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php and add /bin to the PATH or run `sudo apt-get install graphviz` on Ubuntu (see https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/3210)

For installing Tensorflow and Keras we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or 
[Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as Python distribution (we did so for preparing Travis-CI and it worked).

To accelerate training even further, you can make use of your GPU, by installing tensorflow-gpu instead of tensorflow
via pip (note that you can only have one of them) and the required Nvidia drivers. For Windows, we recommend the
[excellent tutorial by Phil Ferriere](https://github.com/philferriere/dlwin). For Linux, we recommend using the
 official tutorials by [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation).

## Training the model

The easiest way to start the training is to run `TrainModel.ps` from the PowerShell.

### Manually start the training
For manually starting the training, make sure to first compile the tools 

    cd keras_frcnn/py_faster_rcnn
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    
then run TrainModel like this

    MusicObjectDetector> python TrainModel.py --network resnet50 --output_weight_path "resnet50.hdf5"
    

# Dataset
If you are just interested in the dataset, the split and the annotations used in this project, you can run the following scripts to reproduce the dataset locally:

    cd keras_frcnn
    python muscima_image_cutter.py
    python DatasetSplitter.py
    
These two scripts will download the datasets automatically, generate cropped images along an Annotation.txt file and split the images into three reproducible parts for training, validation and test.
